I am Application layer of PersonalDetails Microservice. 
I am holding the responsibility of:
1) Creating Interfaces to establish the relation between Infrastructure & Main API (program.cs)
2) Executing the CQRS to call services from Infrastructure
3) Validations  for the Models

I cannot:

2) Call Database APIs


I can be:
1) Connected/referenced via Main API or Infrastructure
